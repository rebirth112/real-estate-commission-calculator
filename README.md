# realtor-commission-calculator

When houses are sold, the listing brokerage takes on a gross commission, calculated by a percentage of the first $100,000 plus some percentage on the remaining balance.

In British Columbia, the listing brokerage takes on 7% on the first $100,000 and 2.5% on the remaining balance typically. This is then divided in half, one half for each REALTOR representing clients in the transaction.

This calculator helps determine what goes to the seller, the buyer (selling commission), and what the overall total is.

This will help real estate agents on both sides of the transaction, as well as the buyer.
